# Bio 👋

Hi! I'm Konrad and I'm a developer advocate currently available for hire. I love writing software in Swift and doing data analysis in Python, but what I enjoy even more is making use of my software engineering and community managements skills to make developers' world more effective and enjoyable. Always willing to do some hard work and talk about developer experience/relations/marketing.
